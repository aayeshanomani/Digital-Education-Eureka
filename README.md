# Digital-Education-Eureka
## A Location Based Tutoring App

## Abstract
Since, teachers cannot focus on each student individually, our mobile application Eureka helps the students to take tuition from people around them. It basically helps them to interact with people who have some knowledge in a specific stream or subject and learn something the other knows. This will help us share whatever we know with others and gain their knowledge too. Eureka integrates the Google Maps API to track the locations of all student requests on campus and displays them with digital pins. It allows each user to create and manage their own account, including the topics they would like to teach and profile picture. They can easily switch between tutor and student depending on their needs. Student requests are displayed across the map while tutor acceptances are displayed in a list view. Tutor and student can communicate easily through the chat area.

## Tech Stack Involved
The application is build completely with Android Studio and the modern language Kotlin. We used Google Firebase as our main authentication and database tool, storing user information, tutoring requests and offers, and user messages. We used the Google Maps API to accurately locate and display all students requesting assistance with their classes.
