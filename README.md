## Abstract

Since, teachers cannot focus on each student individually, our mobile application Eureka helps the students to take tuition from people around them. It basically helps them to interact with people who have some knowledge in a specific stream or subject and learn something the other knows. This will help us share whatever we know with others and gain their knowledge too. Eureka integrates the Google Maps API to track the locations of all student requests on campus and displays them with digital pins. It allows each user to create and manage their own account, including the topics they would like to teach and profile picture. They can easily switch between tutor and student depending on their needs. Student requests are displayed across the map while tutor acceptances are displayed in a list view. Tutor and student can communicate easily through the chat area.

## Tech Stack Involved

The application is built completely with Android Studio and the modern language Kotlin. We used Google Firebase as our main authentication and database tool, storing user information, tutoring requests and offers, and user messages. We used the Google Maps API to accurately locate and display all students requesting assistance with their classes.

## Future Plans

Eureka has virtually endless future potential in the field of education. Some of our future targets include integration of UPI and/or creation of an in-app wallet for easier and secure payments, gamification of the app by introducing ratings, badges and levels for tutors and students and so on. One of the most essential future goals is the expansion of the app to cover multiple campuses. We will also be listing various educational workshops, meetups and other events that are happening around the student's locality, allowing reliable access to quality education.
